 # Predictive Modeling Project: NYC Real Estate and Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project involves predictive modeling on two datasets: NYC real estate data and credit risk data. The goal is to:
- Predict **sale prices** using a linear regression model.
- Predict **loan statuses** using a logistic regression model.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and outliers in both datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized data trends and relationships using heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms.
- **Modeling:**
  - Linear Regression for sale price prediction.
  - Logistic Regression for loan status classification.
- **Advanced Techniques:**
  - Used SMOTE for handling class imbalance in the credit dataset.
  - Evaluated models with metrics like R², MSE, ROC-AUC, and precision-recall.

## Structure
- **Part 1:** Data preparation, including handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Part 2:** Linear regression on real estate data.
- **Part 3:** Logistic regression on credit risk data.
- **Part 4:** Evaluation and justification of model performance.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imbalanced-learn.
- **Techniques:** SMOTE, StandardScaler, ROC-AUC, threshold adjustment for classification.

## Results
- Achieved strong performance metrics:
  - **Linear Regression:** R² = X.XX, MSE = Y.YY.
  - **Logistic Regression:** ROC-AUC = Z.ZZ, accuracy = XX%.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure required libraries are installed.
3. Run the notebooks for each part sequentially.

## Future Work
- Experiment with advanced regression and classification techniques.
- Include additional features to improve model accuracy.
